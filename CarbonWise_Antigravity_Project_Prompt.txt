         CARBON-WISE — ANTIGRAVITY PROJECT PROMPT & FULL WORKFLOW DOCUMENT
         Industry-Ready Lifecycle Vehicle Comparison Engine (India-First)
================================================================================

DOCUMENT VERSION  : 1.0
PROBLEM STATEMENT : 2 — Sustainable Mobility
TEAM TARGET       : Hackathon / Early-Stage Startup
STACK CATEGORY    : Full-Stack Web + Data Engineering + AI/ML Layer


================================================================================
SECTION 1 — PROJECT VISION & MISSION
================================================================================

PROJECT NAME      : Carbon-Wise
TAGLINE           : "Know Before You Drive. Compare Before You Buy."

VISION:
Carbon-Wise is India's first Lifecycle Carbon Intelligence Platform for vehicles.
It is not a car comparison website. It is a truth engine — one that cuts through
manufacturer marketing, greenwashing, and fragmented data to give every Indian
consumer a single, honest number: the true environmental cost of owning a vehicle
over its entire lifetime.

MISSION:
To become the definitive "carbon label" for every vehicle sold in India, enabling
consumers, fleet operators, corporates, and policymakers to make emissions-informed
decisions — backed by real Indian data, real Indian driving conditions, and real
Indian grid intensity — not European or American benchmarks.


================================================================================
SECTION 2 — THE CORE PROBLEM (Expanded)
================================================================================

The Indian automotive market is growing at 8% annually. EVs are being aggressively
marketed as "zero emission" or "green" solutions. But this is misleading for three
critical reasons:

  1. MANUFACTURING BLIND SPOT
     A Tata Nexon EV has a 40.5 kWh battery. Producing that battery emits
     approximately 6,000–8,100 kg of CO₂ before the car even leaves the factory.
     No marketing brochure mentions this.

  2. INDIA GRID PROBLEM
     India's electricity grid carbon intensity is 0.71–0.82 kg CO₂/kWh (CEA 2024),
     nearly 3x cleaner grids in France or Norway. An EV charged in Jharkhand (coal-
     heavy grid) may emit more lifecycle CO₂ than a well-tuned CNG vehicle in Mumbai.
     No platform accounts for this at a state level.

  3. END-OF-LIFE VOID
     India has no large-scale EV battery recycling infrastructure. Batteries going
     to landfill carry a hidden carbon and toxicity penalty that is never disclosed.

RESULT: Consumers are making ₹10–50 lakh purchase decisions with fundamentally
incomplete environmental information. Carbon-Wise fixes this.


================================================================================
SECTION 3 — FULL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------
3A. MANDATORY PLATFORM FEATURES
--------------------------------------------------

[F1] LIFECYCLE CARBON CALCULATOR (CORE ENGINE)
  - Input: Vehicle model, user's state/city, daily mileage (km/day),
           ownership period (years), usage pattern (city/highway/mixed)
  - Formula:
      Total Carbon Cost =
          Manufacturing Emissions (kg CO₂)
        + [Daily Mileage × 365 × Ownership Years × Operational Emission Factor]
        + Battery Disposal Emissions (kg CO₂)  ← EVs/Hybrids only

  - Operational Emission Factor by type:
      ICE Petrol  : (Fuel consumption L/100km / 100) × 2.31 kg CO₂/L
      ICE Diesel  : (Fuel consumption L/100km / 100) × 2.68 kg CO₂/L
      CNG         : (CNG consumption kg/100km / 100) × 2.75 kg CO₂/kg
      EV          : (Energy consumption Wh/km / 1000) × State Grid Intensity
                    × Charging loss factor (1.15)
      Hybrid      : Weighted blend of petrol + battery logic

  - All efficiency figures must use MIDC (Modified Indian Driving Cycle) or
    WMTC data, NOT WLTP or EPA figures.

[F2] STATE-WISE GRID INTENSITY MODULE
  - Dropdown for Indian state selection
  - Dynamic mapping to CEA-published grid intensity (kg CO₂/kWh)
  - Auto-updates EV operational emission calculation in real time
  - Visual indicator: Green (clean grid) to Red (coal-heavy grid) per state

[F3] VEHICLE COMPARISON DASHBOARD
  - Side-by-side comparison of up to 4 vehicles
  - Stacked bar chart: Manufacturing vs Operational vs Disposal breakdown
  - Breakeven point graph: "At your mileage, EV becomes cleaner than ICE at X years"
  - Filter by: vehicle type, budget, seating capacity, fuel type

[F4] SMART RECOMMENDATION ENGINE
  - User enters mileage + state + ownership years + budget
  - System returns Top 3 vehicles with lowest net carbon footprint
  - Explains reasoning in plain language (not just a score)
  - Example output: "At 40 km/day in Karnataka for 7 years, the Maruti CNG
    Grand Vitara has a lower total footprint than the Tata Nexon EV due to
    Karnataka's improving but still moderate grid intensity."

[F5] GREENWASHING DETECTION FLAGS
  - Rule-based flags triggered automatically:
      → "Zero Emission" claim on vehicle with battery manufacturing > 5,000 kg CO₂
      → WLTP mileage claim without MIDC equivalent available
      → EV marketed as "clean" in states with grid intensity > 0.75 kg CO₂/kWh
      → No disclosed battery recycling program from manufacturer
  - Each flag shows: What the claim is, Why it's misleading, What the real data shows

[F6] TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP (TCO) OVERLAY
  - Optional layer showing financial cost alongside carbon cost
  - Inputs: current fuel price, electricity tariff (state-wise), insurance estimate
  - Output: Combined "Carbon + Cost" score — unique to Carbon-Wise


--------------------------------------------------
3B. DIFFERENTIATING FEATURES (Out-of-the-Box)
--------------------------------------------------

[D1] INDIA CARBON PASSPORT — THE BIG DIFFERENTIATOR
  Every vehicle gets a "Carbon Passport" — a single-page shareable certificate
  showing its lifecycle carbon profile in an Indian context.
  - QR code scannable at dealerships
  - Downloadable PDF with verified data sources cited
  - Can be shared on social media ("I chose this car because...")
  - This is the "nutritional label" the problem statement calls for — made real
  - Future monetization: Dealerships pay to display verified Carbon Passports

[D2] FLEET CARBON OPTIMIZER (B2B ANGLE)
  Target corporate fleets, logistics companies, and cab aggregators.
  - Upload CSV of current fleet vehicles
  - Platform calculates total fleet carbon footprint
  - Recommends a transition roadmap: "Replace these 12 diesel vehicles with CNG
    first. Your next 8 replacements should be EVs once Karnataka grid cleans up."
  - ESG Report generator for corporate compliance (BRSR reporting in India)
  - This opens a B2B revenue channel beyond the consumer app

[D3] CARBON BREAKEVEN TIMELINE SIMULATOR
  An interactive animated graph showing:
  - Month-by-month carbon debt of a new EV vs a petrol car
  - The exact month when the EV "pays back" its manufacturing emissions
  - Sensitivity sliders: "What if grid gets 20% cleaner by 2027?" — graph updates live
  - This is a viral, shareable feature that no competitor has

[D4] DEALER GREENWASH SCANNER (Chrome Extension — Bonus)
  A lightweight Chrome extension that:
  - Detects when a user is on a car manufacturer website or Cardekho/CarWale
  - Pulls the vehicle name and overlays Carbon-Wise data in a sidebar
  - Shows real carbon score next to advertised specs
  - Creates a constant touchpoint without requiring users to visit the platform

[D5] COMMUNITY REAL-WORLD DATA LAYER
  - Allow verified users to submit their actual mileage and energy consumption
  - Build India's first crowdsourced real-world efficiency database
  - Show "Lab Efficiency" vs "Community Reported Efficiency" side by side
  - This creates a data moat competitors cannot easily replicate

[D6] REGIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT
  Launch in English + Hindi + Tamil + Kannada
  Carbon literacy is not just an urban English-speaking problem.
  Regional language support makes Carbon-Wise accessible to Tier 2/3 markets
  where EV adoption decisions are being made right now.

================================================================================
SECTION 7 — DEMO SCRIPT FOR PRESENTATION
================================================================================

SCENARIO: "Meet Arjun. He lives in Pune, drives 45 km a day for work, plans to
keep his next car for 6 years, and has a budget of ₹18 lakhs. He wants to make
the greenest choice."

STEP 1: Arjun visits Carbon-Wise. Enters: Pune (Maharashtra), 45 km/day, 6 years.
STEP 2: Recommendation page returns Top 3:
          #1 — Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara CNG (Total: 28,400 kg CO₂)
          #2 — Tata Nexon EV (Total: 31,200 kg CO₂)
          #3 — Hyundai Creta Petrol (Total: 42,800 kg CO₂)
STEP 3: Arjun is surprised. He expected the Nexon EV to win.
         The explanation says: "Maharashtra's grid intensity is 0.83 kg CO₂/kWh.
         The Nexon EV's battery manufacturing debt of 7,290 kg CO₂ takes 7.2 years
         to offset at your mileage. The CNG variant wins within your 6-year window."
STEP 4: Arjun clicks the Breakeven Simulator. He moves the "Grid Improvement" slider
         to +25% cleaner by 2027 (India's stated renewable target).
         → The graph updates live. The EV now breaks even at 5.1 years.
         → He decides to wait 18 months for grid improvement or buy CNG now.
STEP 5: Arjun downloads the Carbon Passport for the Grand Vitara CNG to show
         his family. Shares it on WhatsApp.
STEP 6 (B2B Demo): Switch to Fleet Optimizer.
         Upload CSV of 50-vehicle logistics fleet.
         Platform shows: "Your fleet emits 2,840 tonnes CO₂/year. Replacing your
         15 oldest diesel trucks with CNG reduces this by 34% at lowest capital cost."

RESULT: The judges see a complete, real, India-specific product — not a prototype.
